tiddlywebplugins.utils provides a suite of tools that
make creating and handling plugins in TiddlyWeb a bit
more sensible.

Essentially the utilities raise duplication to a common
core without encumbering the TiddlyWeb core.

It also provides the start of a virtual namespace for mature
TiddlyWeb plugins.
